# Hi, I'm Joshua Noriega ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Currently taking CSC-134 and getting ready to learn C++!

## My Foo (special interest) ðŸŽ¯
I enjoy working on random interests such as creating rocket motors using chemicals, 3d desigining mechanical parts, coding, fiddling around with electronics, and creating projects with all my skills combined. I have created a clock that shoots you with foam darts to wake you up (sadly was destroyed when testing it the first time), a rpg game with randomized drops and loot, and a magnetic zen garden using stepper motors and such. Currently desiging a robot arm that im planning on attaching a camera to to clean up after I'm done experimenting. I'm also interested in aerospace engineering, which is the goal, and really love learning new skills to solve my everyday problems.
